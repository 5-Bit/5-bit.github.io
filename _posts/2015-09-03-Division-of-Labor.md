On {{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }} we met to discuss who would be responsible for different aspects of the project. We determined that we will all be responsible for making updates to this journal. In terms of the programming aspects of this project, we've settled on the following rough division of labor.

### Andrew & John
  - Database with SQL
  - Webservice with Go

### Michael, Hermilo & Mostofa
  - Application with C# & .Net
