On {{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }} we met to discuss who would be responsible for different aspects of the project. We determined that Michael MacCallum will be responsible for making updates to this journal. In terms of the programming aspects of this project, we've settled on the following rough division of labor.

- Andrew Owen - Head Manager (Oversees project development, team lead for web
service)
- Michael MacCallum - Co-Manager (Track meetings and keeps website up to date, GUI
team lead)
- Mostofa Ansary - Front-end programmer (Implement part of GUI, tester)
- Hermilo Calderon - Front-end programmer (Implement part of GUI, testing manager)
- John Zachariah - Back-end programmer (Implement parts of web service, responsible
for idea)

Since our team members vary in experience, jobs and artifacts will be assigned to team
members based on expertise (indicated above) and availability. Communication is a
combination of face to face communication after classes and remote communication team
communication, primarily via Skype. All team members will be given some responsibility
for testing their code. Hermilo will be responsible for ensuring that each member has tested their
code to work well.
