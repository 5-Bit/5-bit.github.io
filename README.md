This website will serve as a journal of our progress creating [Eagleslist](https://github.com/5-Bit/Eagleslist), a textbook trading service for FGCU students.

### Build Instructions (OS X & Linux)

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) if not already installed.
2. Install [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) if not already installed.
3. Run `gem install jekyll` to install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
4. Clone this repository to your computer and change directory into the folder where it's saved.
5. Run `gem install jekyll-mentions jekyll-sitemap` to install dependencies.
6. Run `jekyll serve`. This will generate a "_site" folder containing all the rendered HTML and CSS for the site and start a web server to display it.
