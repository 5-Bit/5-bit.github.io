{{ site.title }} is a lightweight yet powerful form generator which will be available for iOS, Android and the web. It is currently being developed by {{ site.owners | map: "name" | array_to_sentence_string }} as a project for Software Engineering Fundamentals (CEN 3031) at <a href="http://www.fgcu.edu/index.asp">FGCU</a>.

For the time being, this site will serve as a pseudo-blog where we post updates on our progress with the project. Upon completion, this site will host the web version of {{ site.title }} as well as download links for its iOS and Android version.
